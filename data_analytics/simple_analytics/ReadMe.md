# Burgers and Shakeland: Data Analysis Project

This project is a simple analysis project of a fictional restaurant with imprecise timestamps: with a granularity of only an exact hour or quarter hour marks. 


## Tools Used

- Version 1: Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- Version 2: SQL instead of pandas

## Why This Matters

This project presents a sample of my abilities with:
- common table expressions
- window functions
- translating business questions into data-driven answers
