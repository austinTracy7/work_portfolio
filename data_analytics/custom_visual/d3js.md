# Custom Visual
This visual was initially created for a sales event held during the Olympic games. It highlighted the top three sales agents using both some new and the standard sales metrics, while tying into managementâ€™s themed sales weeks for the occasion.

## Tools Used

- PowerBI

## Why This Matters

This project presents a sample of my abilities with:
- being able to go beyond the usual
- Javascript
- addressing edge cases

#### Edge Cases

Not enough contestants to even have a top three
